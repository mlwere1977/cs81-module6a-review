## Overview

This project shows how to create and utilize a unique Playlist object in JavaScript that is customized for Mukwaya Lwere. You can list every song in the playlist, add songs, play and skip tracks, and even remove songs by title. The comprehension of constructors, methods, and how `this` links data and behavior in JavaScript objects is strengthened by this exercise.
